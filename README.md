- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carlosd523, I am from Guatemala and I just started learning how to code. Honestly my biggest dream and aspiration is to change my country.
- Guatemala it's a place where sports aren't widely support and I believe that through my Project Life, I can make a difference and help improve my country.
- Iâ€™ll be uploading my projects to my portfolio, and Iâ€™d love to start working as soon as possible.
- Thank you for reading this! ðŸ˜ƒ
